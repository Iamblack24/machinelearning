# NeuroGen-1B (Resource-Efficient AI Framework)

## Vision
Building an open, resource-efficient AI system that can run on commodity hardware. This is a collaborative project aimed at making AI more accessible while being environmentally conscious.

## Current Status
Early development phase - We're building the foundation for a hybrid AI system that combines:
- Lightweight neural networks (TinyLlama/Phi-based models)
- Symbolic reasoning components
- Memory-efficient knowledge storage

## Realistic Goals
| Target Metric         | Current Status | Goal        | Notes                    |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| RAM Usage            | 4-6 GB        | < 4 GB      | Working on optimization  |
| VRAM Usage           | Optional      | Optional    | CPU-first approach       |
| Response Time        | 2-3s          | < 1s        | With pruned models       |
| Math Processing      | Basic         | Advanced    | Using SymPy integration  |
| Code Analysis        | In Progress   | Production  | Security-focused        |

## Core Features in Development
- **Resource-Efficient Architecture**
  - 4-bit quantization experiments
  - Memory-mapped storage implementation
  - Adaptive compute scheduling

- **Hybrid Intelligence Approach**
  ```python
  # Example of our hybrid processing
  def process_query(query):
      symbolic_result = symbolic_processor.solve(query)
      if symbolic_result.confidence > 0.8:
          return symbolic_result
      return neural_processor.generate(query)
  ```
